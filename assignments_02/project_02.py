# A positive coefficient means that increasing the
# feature raises the predicted daily high, while
# holding the other features constant.
#
# A negative coefficient means that increasing the
# feature lowers the predicted daily high.
#
# Comparing training and testing R² helps identify
# whether the model generalizes well or may be
# overfitting the training data.



# Task 5 Interpretation:
# Adding more features improved the test R² from 0.868
# to 0.909 and reduced RMSE from 3.04°C to 2.53°C.
#
# Low temperature and summer have positive coefficients,
# meaning they raise the predicted high temperature.
# Precipitation and wind speed have negative coefficients,
# meaning they lower the predicted high temperature.
#
# The summer coefficient is about +1.98°C, which means
# summer days are predicted to be warmer when the other
# features stay the same.
#
# I found the negative wind speed coefficient interesting
# because I did not expect wind to be associated with
# lower daily high temperatures.
#
# Training R² (0.884) and testing R² (0.909) are close.
# This suggests the model generalizes reasonably well
# and does not show obvious signs of overfitting.

# --- Task 6: Final Project Summary ---
#
# The dataset contains 365 days of Atlanta weather
# data from 2023. I used 292 days to train the model
# and 73 days to test its predictions.
#
# The full model has an RMSE of 2.53°C, meaning its
# prediction errors are typically around 2.53 degrees
# Celsius. Its R² of 0.909 means it explains about
# 90.9% of the variation in daily high temperatures
# in the test data.
#
# The is_summer feature has the largest absolute
# coefficient (+1.978). Its positive direction means
# the model predicts summer days to be about 1.98°C
# warmer when other features remain constant.
# Because features have different units, coefficient
# sizes do not directly measure overall importance.
#
# One surprising result is that wind speed has a
# negative coefficient (-0.155). This suggests
# higher wind speeds are associated with slightly
# lower predicted daily high temperatures.
